#Decus Design

Install dependencies and start the strapi server and then the Gridsome server:

npm install
npm run develop

the strapi server will run on localhost:1337


##Scope
The page pulls data from Strapi into Gridsom's data store, Strapi was used to display different products on the website which can be easily created on Strapi.
Gridsome is using Vue.js as a front-end framework and in addition I implemented Vuetify, which is a UI framework which is built on top of Vue.js.
